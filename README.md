TiledWave
=========

Tiled Renderer using TiledSharp for Wave Engine

This project requires a reference to TiledSharp - https://github.com/marshallward/TiledSharp

You must pre-compile any images used in your Tiled map and copy the output wpk files from the Asset Exporter output folder into the same relative path that they existed in your Tiled project.

*Tile flipping is not supported currently nor is there exposure to the tile properties, etc from the top level where the renderer is created.
